# Who Am I?

My name is Jason Elwell, and I am a Junior Web Developer.  I'd love to say I'm a *real* developer, but honestly,
I'm just getting started.  I'm based in South-East Michigan and looking to grow my Web Development skills in any
way possible.  I've worked mostly in Customer Service over the years, but my most recent position dealt with configuring
various hardware.

# Web Development Skills

I started building web pages back when tables were the go-to method.  Around 2003 or so, I started building sites for my
guilds/teams/clans in the games I played.  Once I started studying Web Development in college, I felt like I came into a whole
new world.  <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> seemed to be the new way to go about building a site, and I came to like it.

The problem with studying Web Development in my college career, is there hasn't been a class that has taught me a skill that
employers want.  AngularJS, Bootstrap, Wordpress, etc.  So, I have tried to spend my free time learning these resources.

## Languages Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascipt
* PHP
* XML
* Typescript
* Markdown

## Other Assets
* Bootstrap
* Angular2
* jQuery
* Wordpress
* Jekyll

## Still A Long Way To Go

I know how behind I am, mainly because of my resentment towards using code snippets I did not create.  But I quickly realized
that this is how things are done now.  It makes the process much quicker and cleaner than I ever have been able to accomplish.
I can never stop learning these tools, and I hope to integrate more of them into my work.  A new library releases all the time,
and it took me way too long to realize their importance.
