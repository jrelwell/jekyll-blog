Hey there!  I've added a 'Projects' tab so you can see what I accomplished.  Spoiler alert, not much :( .
So far, I have 3 basic Angular 2 examples, but I hope to get more done soon.  There are many frameworks and
libraries I want to play around with, it is hard to choose one and stick with it.  In the future I hope to 
do more with AJAX, various API's, React.js, Wordpress, and maybe some AngularJS.
