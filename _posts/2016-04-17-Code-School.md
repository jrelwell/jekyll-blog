It's been a while since I've updated this blog, but that does not mean that I have not been working!  I recently signed up for a subscription to [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com), and knocking out courses left and right.  Every path that I finish (or when I feel a topic warrants it), I plan to create an example with what I learned.  I recently finished the HTML/CSS path, and applied that knowledge toward a website for the Archer show's "Figgis Detective Agency".

## What I Learned, and What Is Next

Many topics were covered in the HTML/CSS path, it was a nice mix of refreshment and new topics.  Covered topics included:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* SVG
* Mobile/Responsive/Fluid Designs
* Animations with CSS
* Bootstrap
* Color Schemes
* And others

I tried to incorporate most of the topics into the created example I talk about above.  Next up, I am tackling the Javascript path which has been slow going, and much harder than the previous path.  I am just about finished with the basics, and I look forward to refreshing on my jQuery skills.  Past that, the path includes courses on Ember, Backbone, Angular, and more.  I hope to use each of those in their own example sites so I can build diverse portfolio.
